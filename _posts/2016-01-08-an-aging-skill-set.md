## How does a Software Engineer let a skill set age gracefully? 
As an experience Ruby on Rails developer, I think to myself, _"The Rails world had been solving all of my problems for years, why should I change?"_, while nervously eyeing industry trends. We hear whisperings of the rise of Go, Python and Haskell. We see the incredible rise of Angular, React and we wonder if Ember or Backbone will hang on. Hype cycle after hype cycle, where do you hitch your wagon? There is no right or wrong decision, but I have decided to focus on JavaScript (js) for the next year.

## Focus on a new skill
Considering entering the js development world can be a daunting tasks. An incredibly competitive framework ecosystem and a massive module set makes it hard for an uninformed developer. As a classic Rails developer move, I let others form an opinion for me. In this case, instead of DHH and the Rails core team, it was my colleagues. Our staff had chosen Node.js and Angular as our js development.

I was lucky enough to have the ability to begin learning Angular on the job last summer. Our Rails backend work was ahead of schedule and the Angular team needed a warm body. I had tried a few 'Hello, World' Angular apps but never was fully comfortable with the patterns and paradigms presented. Pairing with a senior JavaScript developer got me over the hump. I plan to continue to grow my Angular skills through out the year. However, I still had a Rails mindset for the backend, which brings me to my current focus.

## Diving in deeper
I didn't know it, but that Angular work I did last summer had me glancing at some Node code. I was familiar with the project, but knew nothing substantial about Node, it's strengths or it's weaknesses. It was time to dive in, this time without the benefit of a senior dev walking me through it. My first stop was [NodeSchool](http://nodeschool.io/). NodeSchool provides leveled workshops to introduce to core concepts of node, such as callbacks, io, advanced topics such as Hapi, Express, and Promises as well as general js concepts. It was a great starting point and I highly recommend it.

Next up, I am trying to build some hobby applications in Node. One thing that has been bothering me lately was the stockpile of [growlers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer_bottle#Growler) that has been growing at my house (first world problem, I know). in Minneapolis, there are inconsistent policies from brewery to brewery regarding their return. My hope was to leverage Node and Angular to build a simple solution to that problem. I have started with a Node/Express API, [growlerer](https://github.com/pete2786/growlerer), in which I hope to collect this information. The front end still needs lots of thought.

## The Future
This experience, much like any learning experience is full of frustration, failure and self doubt. However, I am already seeing small signs of progress with my Node and Angular code reading comprehension, increased speed reverse engineering and hiring confidence in debugging features. The next step I'd like to see is confidence in developing a new feature, which to me is an essential test of the mastery of basics of a development stack.

While doing through this process, I answered my original question: "How does a Software Engineer let a skill set age gracefully?". You don't. Try something new, learn, read, go to meetups, ask experienced developers, anything to get you on edge and out of the comfort zone. A confident Software Engineer is one who is never afraid to question their own ideas and notions. A new language, framework or runtime is the perfect thing to keep your professional ego in check. I'll sign off with a summary of a lesson from the late John Riedl, a professor and mentor to many Computer Science students from the University of Minnesota.

# Never stop learning, always be a student. The empathy of a novice is as powerful as the mastery of an expert.
