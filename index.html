          <h2 id="about">Personal</h2>
          <h4>Location</h4>
          <p>
            I currently reside in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokomis,_Minneapolis">Nokomis</a> Neighborhood of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minneapolis">Minneapolis, Minnesota</a>.
          </p>     

          <h4>Family</h4>
          <p>
            I have been married since June 2011 to my wife, Megan. We have a son and a dog.
          </p>

          <h4>Bicycling</h4>
          <p>
            I try to commute by bicycle to work, including as often as possible in the winter months. I also ride trails for leisure as well as off-road mountain biking at nearby trail systems such as Lebanon, <a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_trails/cuyuna_lakes/mtnbiking.html">Cuyuna</a> and <a href="http://www.co.clark.wi.us/index.aspx?NID=228">Levis Mound</a>.
          </p>

          <h4>Beer</h4>
          <p>
            At this time, my favorite local beers are Bauhaus Wonderstuff, Bent Paddle Venture Pils and Surly Furious. My favorite regional/national beers are Bells Two Hearted Ale and Victory Prima Pils.
          </p>

          <h4>Sports</h4>
          <p>
            I am a die-hard <a href="http://www.gophersports.com/">University of Minnesota</a> Gopher basketball, football and hockey fan (in that order) and cheer for all Minnesota sports teams. I am also legally a Green Bay Packer fan by marriage. I also work a Sport's based software company, but spend little of my work time on the sports domain.

          <h2>Professional</h2>
          <h4>Education</h4>
          <p>
            I received my Bachelors of Science in Computer Science, with emphasis in Software Engineering, from the <a href="http://www.cs.umn.edu/index.php">College of Science and Engineering</a> at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities.
          </p>

          <h4>Career</h4>
          <p>
            I am a Software Engineer at <a href="http://sportngin.com">Sport Ngin</a> in Minneapolis. I primarly use <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> and Angular for development. Sport Ngin has lots of <a href="https://github.com/sportngin">cool open source projects</a> which are worth checking out.</p>

            <p>
              In addition to my responsibilities at the Sport Ngin, I do occasional freelance Ruby on Rails development projects. I have also done data modeling and reporting with Oracle Business Intelligence and Tableau.

      <h2 id="thoughts">Thoughts/Opinions</h2>
      <p>This will be the place I dump my thoughts on being a developer, father, and other topics that interest me and maybe you too! I try my best to tag posts properly so new father's aren't stuck reading about software complaining. More coming soon.</p>

          <p>In 2013, a few University developers and I created a blended unconference and hackathon we called "Campus Codefest" (CCF). The tools available were tolerable to plan the event, but missing a few key features. The CCF app blends idea generation, voting, volunteering and event registration. The application can be used by any organization, but currently the primary organization using it is the University of Minnesota.
