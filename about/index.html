          <h2 id="about">Personal</h2>
          <h4>Location</h4>
          <p>
            I currently reside in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokomis,_Minneapolis">Nokomis</a> Neighborhood of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minneapolis">Minneapolis, Minnesota</a>.
          </p>     

          <h4>Family</h4>
          <p>
            I have been married for over four years to my wife, Megan. We have a son and a dog.
          </p>

          <h4>Bicycling</h4>
          <p>
            I try to commute by bicycle to work, including as often as possible in the winter months. I also ride trails for leisure as well as off-road mountain biking at nearby trail systems such as Lebanon, <a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_trails/cuyuna_lakes/mtnbiking.html">Cuyuna</a> and <a href="http://www.co.clark.wi.us/index.aspx?NID=228">Levis Mound</a>.
          </p>

          <h4>Travel</h4>
          <p>
            Thanks to my brother, I spent a living and working in Yeosu, South Korea. I have been bit with the travel bug ever since, and hope to spend another part of my life living abroad in the future. In the mean time, I try to travel as much as possible, most recently to Ireland.
          </p>

          <h4>Sports</h4>
          <p>
            I am a die-hard <a href="http://www.gophersports.com/">University of Minnesota</a> Gopher basketball, football and hockey fan (in that order) and cheer for all Minnesota sports teams. I am also legally a Green Bay Packer fan by marriage. I also work a Sports based software company, but spend little of my work time on the sports domain.

          <p>
            CoEventer is a collaborative, idea driven event planning tool. Unconferences, hackathons and other events with community driven agendas require some upfront work. CoEventer helps you from start to finish. I originally developed this app to help with the University of Minnesota Campus Codefest event. It has recently been adopted by [Open Twin Cities](http://www.opentwincities.org/) to help run future hackathons.
