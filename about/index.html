          <h4>Location</h4>
          <p>
            I currently reside in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokomis,_Minneapolis">Nokomis</a> Neighborhood of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minneapolis">Minneapolis, Minnesota</a>.

            I have been married since June 2011 to my wife, Megan. We have a son and a dog.
          </p>

          <h4>Bicycling</h4>
          <p>
            I try to commute by bicycle to work, including as often as possible in the winter months. I also ride trails for leisure as well as off-road mountain biking at nearby trail systems such as Lebanon, <a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_trails/cuyuna_lakes/mtnbiking.html">Cuyuna</a> and <a href="http://www.co.clark.wi.us/index.aspx?NID=228">Levis Mound</a>.
          </p>

          <h4>Beer</h4>
          <p>
            At this time, my favorite local beers are Bauhaus Wonderstuff, Bent Paddle Venture Pils and Surly Furious. My favorite regional/national beers are Bells Two Hearted Ale and Victory Prima Pils.
          </p>

          <h4>Sports</h4>
          <p>
            I am a die-hard <a href="http://www.gophersports.com/">University of Minnesota</a> Gopher basketball, football and hockey fan (in that order) and cheer for all Minnesota sports teams. I am also legally a Green Bay Packer fan by marriage. I also work a Sport's based software company, but spend little of my work time on the sports domain.

          <p>In 2013, a few University developers and I created a blended unconference and hackathon we called "Campus Codefest" (CCF). The tools available were tolerable to plan the event, but missing a few key features. The CCF app blends idea generation, voting, volunteering and event registration. The application can be used by any organization, but currently the primary organization using it is the University of Minnesota.
